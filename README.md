Collection of some childish things that I wrote

# MY CAT
If you are sad I’ll lend you my cat.
My words are clumsy but my cat is fluffy.
You need not be good or know what to do.
Just lie down flat and let you belly exposed.
It’ll find you and your softest spot.

The trick is to be still and to not rush.
It may lay on your belly and tuck away its nose.
You have things to do and places to be.
But hold, spread and stay still.
Let my fluffy cat warm your softest spot.
How does it know?
It’s called instinct, 
something words don’t own.

# A businessman who’s met them all

Honk honk away you go
Here comes the businessman who’s met them all

Who have you met? the birdwatcher asks
I’ve met a giant who is tree-tall
You have met them all, the birdwatcher notes

Who have you met? the trainspotter asks
I’ve met a lady whose hair is waterfall-soft
You have met them all, the trainspotter hoots

Who have you met? the stargazer asks
I’ve met a singer whose neck is swan-long
You have met them all, the stargazer lulls

A businessman who’s met them all.

Not all, says the dog-walker

How would you know! Hollers the businessman

Have you met the eyes that make nights days?

No, says the businessman

Have you met the smiles that make hearts race?

No, says the businessman 

Have you met the roaring belly that makes the ground shakes? 

No, says the businessman 

Then sir, you have not met them all.

Where do I meet them? Asks the businessman

Visit the house with cackling fire in Shropshire,
There lives Tycho— 
the sparkling eyes, 
the enchanting smiles, 
the roaring belly.

Then I’ve met them all?

No, sir. You won’t.

Come back 3 years following, 
13 years following, 
30 years following and many more.

Then I’ve met them all?

No, sir.
You will still not have met him all.

# Lost senses

And all I can do is
To See,
Not seeing,
And not saw.
To see without time,
But with a chaos that wrangles within.
It is frightening—
Where does the self go when one exists only: to see, to hear, to touch, and to move,
Kinaesthetically in a linearly predictable manner.

I,
see without the ears,
hear without the eyes,
touch without the force,
move without the heat.

The most frightening thing is,
It’s always been this way.
The painful awakening to this knowledge.

People told me this awakening is an
opportunity.
Knowledge is better than ignorance and arrogance.

Existing with half a soul
With half senses,
Glass half full or half empty (sorry about the cliche).

Half full you say.
Perhaps so.
Be patient, Anna.
Bid your time.
